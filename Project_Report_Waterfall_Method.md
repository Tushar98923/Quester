- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend technologies for user interface.

### 1.5 Project Structure Overview

The project is organized into modules separating concerns such as models, routes, templates, and static assets. This structure promotes code reuse, easier maintenance, and collaborative development.

### 1.6 Summary

This introduction sets the stage for the detailed exploration of the projectâ€™s development lifecycle, methodologies, and technical implementations that follow in subsequent sections.

## 2. Waterfall Model Overview

The waterfall model is a traditional software development methodology characterized by a linear and sequential approach. It is one of the earliest SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) models and is widely used for projects with well-defined requirements.

In this model, the development process flows steadily downwards through distinct phases, much like a waterfall. Each phase must be completed fully before the next phase begins, and there is little to no overlap between phases. This approach emphasizes thorough documentation and upfront planning, which helps in managing project scope and expectations.

The waterfall model was chosen for this project to provide a clear structure and milestones, ensuring that each stage of development is carefully planned and executed.

### 2.1 Phases of the Waterfall Model

The phases followed in this project include:

- **Requirements Gathering and Analysis**: Collecting and documenting all functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders. This phase ensures a clear understanding of what the system should achieve.

- **System Design**: Creating architectural and detailed design documents that specify system components, data flow, interfaces, and database schema. This phase translates requirements into a blueprint for implementation.

- **Implementation**: Writing the actual code based on the design documents. Developers build the system modules and integrate them.

- **Testing**: Verifying that the system meets the specified requirements. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

- **Deployment**: Releasing the system to the production environment where end-users can access it.

- **Maintenance**: Ongoing support and updates to fix bugs, improve performance, and add new features as needed.

### 2.2 Advantages of the Waterfall Model

- Clear project milestones and deliverables.
- Well-documented requirements and design.
- Easy to manage due to its linear nature.
- Suitable for projects with stable requirements.

### 2.3 Limitations

- Inflexible to changes once a phase is completed.
- Late discovery of issues since testing occurs after implementation.
- Not ideal for projects with evolving requirements.

### 2.4 Application to This Project

Given the well-defined scope and requirements of this forum application, the waterfall model provided a structured approach to development. It facilitated clear documentation and helped maintain focus on deliverables at each stage.

The model also supported thorough testing and quality assurance before deployment, ensuring a reliable and maintainable system.

## 3. Functionality Requirements

The forum application provides a comprehensive set of features to support user interaction and content management. These functionalities are designed to create an engaging, intuitive, and secure platform for users to communicate and share content.

### 3.1 User Registration and Authentication

Users can create accounts by providing unique usernames and valid email addresses. The registration process includes validation to prevent duplicate accounts and ensure data integrity. Authentication mechanisms allow users to securely log in and log out, with password hashing implemented to protect credentials. Future enhancements include password reset and multi-factor authentication.

### 3.2 Post Management

Users have the ability to create new posts with titles, content, categories, and tags to facilitate organization and discovery. Posts can be edited or deleted by their authors, with timestamps indicating creation and modification times. The system supports filtering posts by categories and tags, enabling users to find relevant content efficiently.

### 3.3 Commenting System

The application supports a robust commenting system where users can comment on posts and reply to other comments, allowing for nested discussions. Users can edit or delete their comments, with metadata such as author information and timestamps displayed. This feature encourages dynamic and interactive conversations.

### 3.4 Reactions

To foster engagement, users can react to posts and comments by liking or disliking them. Reaction counts are displayed prominently, providing feedback to content creators. The system ensures that each user can react only once per post or comment to maintain fairness.

### 3.5 Notifications

Users receive real-time notifications for various interactions, including likes, comments, mentions, and follows. Notifications can be marked as read or viewed, helping users stay informed about relevant activities. This feature enhances user retention and interaction.

### 3.6 Search Functionality

A powerful search engine allows users to find posts and other users using keywords. The search supports filtering and sorting to improve result relevance. This functionality aids in content discovery and community building.

### 3.7 User Settings

Users can customize their experience through settings that include theme selection, notification preferences, privacy controls, and profile customization. Options to upload profile pictures and manage social links are also provided, allowing users to personalize their presence.

### 3.8 Snippet Sharing

The application enables users to create shareable snippets of posts or comments, generating unique URLs for easy sharing. This feature facilitates content dissemination across platforms.

### 3.9 Behavior Tracking

User actions are tracked to provide personalized content recommendations. This includes monitoring interactions such as post views, reactions, and comments to tailor the user experience.

These functionalities ensure an engaging and interactive user experience while maintaining content organization and user privacy.
